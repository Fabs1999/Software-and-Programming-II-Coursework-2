🚀 Headgear and CargoBox Management System

Welcome to the Headgear and CargoBox Management System – a Java-powered exploration into the world of object-oriented design and a playful mix of crowns, helmets, and cargo boxes! 🎩👑

📚 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced Java programming concepts, featuring:
	•	Headgear Hierarchy: A diverse lineup of headgear (Crown, Helmet, BobbleHat, and more!) with unique attributes and value computations.
	•	CargoBox Management: A dynamic CargoBox class to store, filter, and query items and headgear efficiently.
	•	Testing Framework: Custom-built tests to validate functionality, alongside practical examples.

Whether it’s a crown valued by jewels or a helmet with a protective visor, this project explores creativity and practicality through solid programming principles.

✨ Features

	•	Headgear Goodness:
	•	Compute values for items like Crown (based on jewels) or ScooterHelmet (based on protection and visor presence).
	•	Check attributes like weight, type, and safety certification.
	•	Dynamic CargoBox:
	•	Add, remove, or filter items and headgear.
	•	Query total weight, find the heaviest CargoBox, and more!
	•	Custom Testing:
	•	Validate methods using our mini “home-grown” testing framework.
	•	Includes test classes for thorough coverage.

 📁 File Structure

	•	Headgear: The base interface for all headgear, with methods like getWeight, getType, and valueComputed.
	•	CargoBox: A versatile class for managing collections of Item and Headgear.
	•	Testing:
	•	HeadgearTest and CargoBoxTest for hands-on functionality checks.
	•	Coursework1Main for automated test validation.

 🎯 Learning Objectives

	•	Master object-oriented design principles like inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
	•	Explore creative programming by modeling real-world objects with code.
	•	Build and validate functionalities through structured tests.
